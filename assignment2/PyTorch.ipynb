So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).

This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n","- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.\n","\n","### Tips for training\n","For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n","- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n","- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n","  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n","  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n","\n","### Have fun and happy training!
