# README

This repo contains all the three assignments I did for the popular class CS231n, which covers most of the hot topics in deep learning like CNN, RNN, GAN, etc. 

The [assignments](https://cs231n.github.io/) are from 2021, but the [course materials](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/syllabus.html) that I used are from 2017 since video lectures are only available in 2017. 

Assignment 1&2 are the main parts and seem to stay the same every year since 2017, which is to help us develop the fundamental skills needed for research and industry projects with confidence. It is mainly about implementing all sorts of layers using Python/Numpy from scratch, coupled with some tasks for us to familiarize with PyTorch (a modern and convenient framework).

Assignment 3 is a bit different each year, so I skipped those ones not covered in 2017 (like Transformer and Self-supervised learning, which are not essential for the main theme but I may come back to it later).
